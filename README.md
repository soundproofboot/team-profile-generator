## Installation
Clone this repo. Then run 'npm install' in the terminal. Once the dependencies have been installed, simply type 'node .' to start the application. 

## Usage
You will first receive prompts for all of the manager's information, after which you have the option to add more members or to finish the profile. If you choose to add more members, choose either engineer or intern. After you've responded to all of the prompts, an HTML file will be created in the 'dist' folder containing all of the information provided. A style sheet is also provided in the dist folder.

## Contributing
This application uses the npm packages 'inquirer' to handle the prompts, and 'jest' to handle testing.

## Tests
Tests are provided to verify that new instances of classes are created with all the necessary information. All tests are run with the jest testing framework.
